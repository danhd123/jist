# memory_manager.s a module to manage the OS memory use instead of the sbrk macro in sys_macros.m
#     however we still need sbrk macro because this module relies on it.

# HOW THE MEMORY ALLOCATOR WILL WORK
# the memory allocator will be a way to manage the memory in the heap while the sbrk syscall
# allocates memory in the heap it cannot free memory. Thus the operating system needs a way
# to free and compact the heap when blocks of memory are released by either the OS or
# a user program.
#
# A program will request memory by asks for x number of words. the programs will not be able to
# request by number of bytes. The user programs will not get back the address of the memory instead
# they will get back a unique identifier for there memory. When they want a word from their memory
# their programs will use a global macro that will be part of this library. ie they will pass the 
# macro their memory id and the word they want (ie 0, 1, 2, 3 ... n) and the system will return the
# value of the word in from their memory block.
#
# The memory manager will allow users to free memory when they are done with it. When a piece of 
# memory is free the heap will be compacted by the memory manager so that their will be no empty 
# space. This is the reason that the user will never be given the address of their memory. The 
# address will not remain constant so the users cannot have them.
#
# At the very top of the heap will be a control structure. in essance it will be a assending sorted
# list of memory blocks in use sorted by the memory id number. It will look like this.
#
# Structure of Heap Control Block
# -------------------------------------
# | The Sorted List Inside the Block  |
# | --------------------------------- |
# | | Size in Words of the Block    | |
# | | Address of the Memory Block   | |
# | | Memory id N                   | |
# | --------------------------------- |
# | --------------------------------- |
# | |                               | |
# | |             ...               | |
# | |                               | |
# | --------------------------------- |
# | --------------------------------- |
# | | Size in Words of the Block    | |
# | | Address of the Memory Block   | |
# | | Memory id 0                   | |
# | --------------------------------- |
# -------------------------------------
# |                                   | -> ie what is the farthest the heap can grow with doing
# | Address of the Top of the Heap    |    another sbrk call. this includes the space that the 
# |                                   |    Heap Control Block is occupying
# -------------------------------------
# | Next Memory id                    |
# -------------------------------------
# | Size in Words of Control Block    |
# -------------------------------------
#
# The heap control block will grow in size as the number of blocks in the heap grows and it will 
# shrink at as blocks of memory are free. There will be a special label called HPC_ADDR which will
# store the start of the heap control block. This will make it quicker to access the block. That
# way the memory manager doesn't have to walk the entire heap to get to the control block.
